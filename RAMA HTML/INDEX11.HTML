      The equation for calculating the area of a square is:
      <strong>A = s<sup>2</sup> </strong> , where A is the area and s is the
      side length.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Pythagorean theorem is:
      <strong> a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup></strong
      >, where a and b are the legs of a right triangle, and c is the
      hypotenuse.
    </p>

      The formula for compound interest is:
      <strong> A = P(1 + r/n)<sup>nt</sup> </strong>, where A is the amount of
      money accumulated after n years, including interest.
